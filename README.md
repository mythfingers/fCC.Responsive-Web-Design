Student Work projects from FreeCodeCamp in various states of completion. 

Right now what you see is a demonstration of work from the Responsive Web Design course.

The projects here are meant to showcase a working knowledge of HTML and CSS. specifically with regard to responsive styling across mobile and desktop.

---Self-Critique: I think given that mobile is the dominant device these days, I would have restructured my approach had I known how media rules worked right away.
    Right now, the @media rules size the pages down from the baseline desktop version. 
    I think it would have made more sense to start small and then scale up.
