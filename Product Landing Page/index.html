                  <span class='card-spacer'></span>
                  <p>After a heart-wrenching near-miss in the 2206 season, where Kaelan finished just shy of the championship, the Dublin native is determined to make his mark in 2207. His tenacity and unmatched agility make him a formidable force on the track, and this year, he’s armed with FEISAR’s latest anti-gravity ship. O'Reilly's hunger for victory has never been greater, and he’s poised to challenge every rival in his path. With the taste of almost triumph still fresh, he’s ready to unleash his full potential and secure the pilot's championship.</p></p>

                <p>The fierce competitor from Barcelona, Elena faced her own share of drama last season, narrowly missing the podium in several key races due to a late-season mishap. Unfazed, she returns stronger and more focused than ever, eager to prove her mettle in the 2207 season. With FEISAR's advanced ship at her disposal, Santiago's strategic brilliance and lightning-fast reflexes position her as a serious contender. She’s not just racing to win; she’s racing to assert her dominance and claim the pilot's championship, ensuring that her past setbacks fuel her drive for glory.</p>
